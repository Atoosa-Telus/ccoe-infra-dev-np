# Definitions
## Code Tag
A [code tag](https://canadiancoding.ca/posts/post/python/codetags/) is a predefined phrase (usually in all caps) that has a specific meaning. For example TODO is a CodeTag that lets people who are reading the comment know that something needs to be done.

The typical syntax for this is `<CODETAG>: <Description>` for example:
```
username = input("enter username: ") TODO: Save user input after entry
```
```
 NOTE: A general note/mild warning

 HACK: Temporary solution to a problem, to be properly solved later

 PORT: An OS/Platform specific workaround

 IDEA: An idea to solve an issue (Not that useful unless solution will take time to implement)

 REQ: Requirement for a file/function/class

 FAQ: A frequently asked question

 SEE: Point to a reference such as a documentation link, or other function

 TODO: As the name implies, tells people/you something that needs to be done (very useful for multi-day/multi-developer projects)
 
 FIXME: Addresses a problem that should be fixed in the code

 BUG: Identifies a known bug

 WONTFIX: Put next to something you know has an unintended/unexpected outcome, but have no intention to fix

 CAVEAT: A caveat to the implementation; something that is not so obvious to layman's, or first time users necessarily

 DOCUMENT:Need to write documentation
 ```
